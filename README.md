# Zero Hour

A space shmup game I made for a school project using the HTML5 game framework [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3).

## How to play

This app is hosted using heroku. Simply go to the site https://thepiguy-zero-hour.herokuapp.com/ to view the game. The source code is located under the js/ repository.

## How to develop

1. First of all, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build:dev` to build the files. It will watch your files for any changes and automatically update them, so you will need to open another command prompt to start the server. 
5. Run `npm start` to launch the server, and then just navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the game.
